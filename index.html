            <p>A to-do list is a simple application that allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, and deleting
                items. It typically includes functionality for marking tasks as complete or pending. Tasks can be
                dynamically added or removed from the list using JavaScript, and the list is often stored in memory or a
                backend database. The goal of a to-do list is to help users stay organized and track their progress on
                various tasks.</p>
